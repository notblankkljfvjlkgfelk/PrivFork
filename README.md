## Corkey
This exploit allows you to **corrupt extensions** interrupting the sync process.
<br/>

![corrupt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1665178f-dd59-46fe-91c1-fabebfa5e5b6)

<br/>

Discovered by [AkaButNice](https://github.com/Aka-but-nice), [Bypassi#7037](https://github.com/bypassiwastaken)
<br/>
Named by [Ashton Davies](https://github.com/AshtonDavies) & [Brandon421-ops](https://github.com/Brandon421-ops) (Their github page was deleted)

### How do I use it?

**You will have to factory reset your chromebook so make sure you know your wifi password at home or at school (I advise doing this at home) and make sure you sync all of the files you want to save into your google drive**
<br/>

**You must have acess to login without wifi (sign in as an existing user)**
<br/>

**If your organization does not allow you to sign in without a network, you should instead prevent internet access on your network.**
<br/>

**This requires precise timing and good reflexes**

1. Powerwash / Factory Reset

   Press **Esc** + **Refresh**![refresh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d83e38-ece5-4433-8acc-5d3b452e9245) + **Power**![power](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d03cbb1-9c6c-45ae-822c-648de734c3d5)

   Press **CTRL+D** on the recovery/insert USB screen

   Press **Enter**

2. Sign in
3. Immediatly disconnect from your network
4. Press **Refresh**![refresh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d83e38-ece5-4433-8acc-5d3b452e9245) + **Power**![power](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d03cbb1-9c6c-45ae-822c-648de734c3d5)
5. Navigate to the url <ins>chrome://extensions</ins>
6. Connect to your network
7. Wait for the extension that you want to corrupt automatically install
8. **Immediately** disconnect from your network and restart
9. Sign in again as an existing user with no wifi to ensure the extension was corrupted just like what the image showed

   The other extensions shouldn't install

**Slightly Bad Scenario:** If you don't see any extenison or any of the extensions installed then you are gonna have to **try again** (do steps 7 - 9 again) and maybe do step 8 a little later but not too late otherwise it will fully install

**Worse Case Scenario:** If the extension if installed but its not corrupted you are going to have to **do it all over again** this means factory resseting once again

**Best Case Scenario:** You did it!! Repair any extensions you want to fix and restart your chromebook and **log in with your wifi** on again to fix your files not being able to be opened for download

## ExtHang3r
𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗴𝟯𝗿 is an exploit that allows ChromeOS users to 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 after the LTMEAT patch. It remains unpatched in all new ChromeOS versions as of November 2024.

Created by [Blobby](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi)

### How do I use it?
Download the <a href="https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Ext-Hang3r.html">HTML file</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Ext-Hang3r">copy the data: link and paste it into a new tab</a>

### Note
When you start hanging it will take longer than one minute and it will lag a ton since it is refreshing iframes, so I recommend closing all your other tabs before hanging. If you are using securly please use ``securly (old)`` to disable Securly for Chromebooks.

<br/>
Improved Version by [STPv22](https://github.com/STPv22)

### How do I use it?
1. <a href="https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Dextensify.html">Open up the HTML file</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Agguiopz/Priv/blob/main/Dextensify">Copy the data: link and paste it into a new tab</a>
2. Open up your settings page for your extension (if you are using securly use **Securly for Chromebooks**
3. If you are on Securly use **Freeze Securly (old)** to bypass blocked pages. The other extensions are fine since it's usually just one extension
4. Press ok then instantly switch back to your extension page and start spamming ``Allow access to file URLs``
5. While you are in a middle of a laggy state wait a few seconds then instantly press your url bar and go to any website or smth and close the dextensify page
6. Note that the extension may turn back on at random intervals which is why you must sometimes have to press ``Allow access to file URLs`` again every few minutes
